# PR Comments

Post review findings as inline comments on specific diff lines via the GitHub Pull Request Reviews API and `gh` CLI.

## When to Use

- After `pr-review` produces findings and user wants them posted to the PR
- User asks to "add comments", "submit the review", "comment on the lines", or "do an actual review"

## Step 0: Decide Whether to Post Comments

**Before doing anything else**, check the pr-review output:

- Before submitting any review, fetch PR status checks with `gh pr view <number> --repo daltoniam/switchboard_plugins --json statusCheckRollup` and include a short status summary in the review body or fallback comment.
- If the review found **zero Must Fix and zero Should Fix items**, submit an `APPROVE` review with a short body like "Clean PR — CI/status checks are passing and I didn't find any blocking issues. LGTM." and **no inline comments**. Then stop.
- If GitHub rejects the approval because the token belongs to the PR author, post a regular PR comment with the same short positive summary, include the CI/status check summary, and mention that approval was blocked by GitHub's own-PR restriction. Then stop.
- If only "Consider" items exist and they're truly optional, approve without inline comments. If approval is blocked by GitHub's own-PR restriction, post a regular PR comment summarizing that the review found no blocking issues and include the CI/status check summary.
- Only proceed to Step 1 if there are **concrete, actionable findings** worth commenting on.

**Never post test/placeholder comments.** Every comment submitted to the PR must contain real, substantive feedback.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Data

1. Get owner, repo, PR number
2. Get head commit SHA: `gh api repos/daltoniam/switchboard_plugins/pulls/<number> --jq '.head.sha'`
3. Get the diff: `gh pr diff <number> --repo daltoniam/switchboard_plugins`
4. Check existing comments: `gh api repos/daltoniam/switchboard_plugins/pulls/<number>/comments` — don't duplicate

### Step 2: Map Findings to Diff Lines

The API only accepts lines that appear in the diff. For each finding, confirm the target line is in a `+` or context line. If not, use the nearest line in the same hunk.

### Step 3: Build Payload with Python

Always use a Python script to build the JSON — avoids shell escaping issues with Markdown and code fences:

```python
import json

comments = [
    {
        "path": "plugins/example/src/lib.rs",
        "line": 42,
        "side": "RIGHT",
        "body": "This handler can panic on malformed input. We should return a structured Switchboard error instead so the host can surface the failure cleanly."
    },
]

payload = {
    "commit_id": "<sha>",
    "event": "COMMENT",
    "body": "Looks good overall. I left a couple of concrete things inline.",
    "comments": comments,
}

with open("/tmp/review_payload.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(payload, f)
```

Then submit:

```bash
gh api repos/daltoniam/switchboard_plugins/pulls/<number>/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --input /tmp/review_payload.json \
  --jq '.html_url'
```

### Step 4: Handle Errors

- **422 line not in diff**: Use nearest diff line in the same hunk
- **422 validation failed**: Re-fetch head SHA and retry — branch may have been updated
- **403 not accessible**: Fall back to `gh pr comment <number> --repo daltoniam/switchboard_plugins --body "..."`

## Comment Voice and Style

Write comments like a peer reviewer who's read the code carefully and is being helpful, not like an automated tool generating a report.

**Key rules:**

- **No severity titles or labels.** Don't start comments with "Must Fix —", "Should Fix —", "Nit —", or any bolded header/title.
- **Conversational, not formulaic.** Each comment should feel like its own thought, not a template fill-in.
- **Lead with the problem, not a category.** Say what can break and why.
- **Keep it tight.** 2-4 sentences is usually enough.
- **Code suggestions are inline.** Drop code blocks naturally after explaining the issue.
- **Skip the preamble.** Don't start every comment with "Great work but...".
- **Use "we" and "this" not "you should".**
- **One idea per comment.** Don't combine unrelated issues.

**Overall review body:** Keep the top-level review summary to 1-2 natural sentences. Lead with something positive if warranted, mention roughly how many things to look at.

**Event type:** Choose the event based on the review findings from `pr-review`:

- `"APPROVE"` — if there are **no Must Fix items** in the review. Non-blocking suggestions are fine alongside approval.
- `"REQUEST_CHANGES"` — if the user explicitly asks to block the PR.
- `"COMMENT"` — if there are blocking items but the user hasn't explicitly asked to block.
